--- todo ---
add frequency to CSV format (in conjunction w/ site)
connection error message friendliness
x-scanned-in-y addition to dashboard
restage local DB from CSV export (partially complete)
"silver lining" coverage in network detail activity (like site)
optional low-contrast background signal graphs for list items
pause/play on notification view, affects gps+wifi
stop counting on startup
show countdown while trying to close database
debug logging mode
add download of cell and BT observed
tablet list+map layout
NFC logging
simple map circle mode if label+clustering off
retry file upload for written-upload failed
limited backoff for failed uploads
extended android auto support
integrate group stats view
express density in path display


--- user suggested ---
map-page type filter on four csv/kml exports
be able to disable cell tower recording, and/or filter kml output
kismet drone support
some response/info/stat about uploaded files (user stats?)
first run wizard to make easier setup wiglewifi
TTS improvements:
  - speak similar AP's with count, trying to condense somehow, start with s/\d+$//
  - filter for speaking AP's to avoid very regular ones
    attwifi belkin CableWiFi CenturyLink DIRECT- HOME- HP NETGEAR SLCSD WiFi Hotspot XFINITY xfinitywifi
  - summarize AP's since last audio speech
configurable sounds for new nets
stats on what is in the local db
"only new" on map work with labels too
scan on/off toggle added to the dashboard tab
decoding base64 (assuming ssid)
switch between Google Maps/OSM (requires OSM tile server)
a widget


--- handled by intents + external package ---
* option to stop scanning when not plugged in
* upload and/or pause on when connected to this network
* pause at battery level instead of kill
* geofence for "don't record" and/or "do upload"


--- complete/obivated? ---
import files, instead of uploading to site and downloading to app
rssi on kml export
on networkactivity record more observations on that network (site survey)


--- ideas that have problematic trade-offs ---
* iterative uploads import from wigle (slows local DB interaction)
* username not found notice (adds information leak in a&a infra)
* implement heatmap (interpolation is inaccurate)
* limit list to one ssid, show multiple observations (see Network activity)
* store system time on db records, not just gps time (GPS time more likely accurate)
* disable notification bar icon option (breaks foreground service contract)
* remove authed-only items for unauthorized users
* allow device settings sync via WiGLE (different devices need different settings)
